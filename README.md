python solution for build XML

1. using os walk to check all files in the current directory and subdirectories.
2. trying to parse the XML. the first time probably will fail since the XML file contains "junk".
3. the exception caching the line where the parse is failed.
4. send the file to function that creates a new file only with XML structure.
5. send the file back to theÂ  XML parsing function. removing the new file.
